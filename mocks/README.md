## Design Principles

### Unified Design System
- **Color Palette**: Primary blue (#0ea5e9), semantic colors for status
- **Typography**: Inter font family, consistent size scale
- **Spacing**: 4px base unit system
- **Components**: Standardized across platforms with platform-specific adaptations

### Platform-Specific Guidelines
- **iOS**: Follows Human Interface Guidelines, uses SF Symbols, native navigation
- **Android**: Follows Material Design 3, uses Material icons, FABs for primary actions
- **Web**: Responsive design, optimized for desktop and tablet use

### Key Features Demonstrated
1. **Onboarding Flow**: Registration, login, tutorial
2. **Home Interface**: Notes/Tasks/Issues tabs with multiple view modes
3. **Create/Edit**: Rich text editor for content creation
4. **Detail Views**: Content display with comments and assignments
5. **Notifications**: Centralized notification management
6. **Group Management**: Member roles and permissions

### Design Modes
- **Light Mode**: Default theme with bright backgrounds
- **Dark Mode**: Dark theme for low-light usage
- **Responsive**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts

### Accessibility
- High contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- Touch target sizes (minimum 44px/dp)
